# CartIQ 🛒⚡

**Golf cart market intelligence for Florida & Georgia buyers.**

CartIQ helps buyers compare dealer, private-party, and retail golf cart listings with delivery-adjusted pricing, battery risk scoring, and a deal rating engine — so you always know whether a cart is a great deal or overpriced before you buy.

## Features

### For Buyers
- **Deal Rating Engine** — every listing is scored against CartIQ's estimated market value (EV): `great_deal`, `good_deal`, `fair_price`, `high_price`, or `over_market`
- **Delivery-Adjusted Pricing** — total delivered cost (TDC) is used for all comparisons, not just sticker price
- **Battery Risk Score** — flags aging lead-acid packs and estimates replacement cost impact
- **Buyer Score** — composite 0–100 score weighing deal delta, battery age, charger, warranty, and delivery
- **Deal Checker** — paste any listing details and get an instant CartIQ analysis without it being in the database
- **My Garage** — save listings (heart) and watch for price drops (bell); email-based, no password required
- **Price Drop Alerts** — watches fire automatically when an admin reduces a listing price
- **Buyer Guide** — SEO content articles covering golf cart buying tips, battery types, street legal requirements, and more
- **Quick Search** — one-click city filters for Nocatee FL, The Villages FL, Jacksonville FL, Orlando FL, Atlanta GA, Peachtree City GA

### For Sellers / Dealers
- **Sell My Cart** — self-submission form for private sellers and dealers
- **CSV Bulk Import** — admin can upload a CSV of multiple listings at once

### For Admins
- **Admin Portal** — password-protected listing management (create, edit, delete, price updates)
- **Inventory Source Management** — track which data sources listings came from
- **Rate-Limited API** — deal-check endpoint is rate limited to prevent abuse

```

The frontend is a single-page app using **hash-based routing** (`/#/search`, `/#/garage`, etc.) for iframe compatibility. All API calls go to `/api/*` on the same origin.

The server serves the built static frontend from `dist/public` in production, so the entire app is a single deployable Node.js process.

## Pricing Engine

Located in `server/pricing.ts`. The engine computes three key values for every listing:

### CartIQ Estimated Value (EV)

A market-based estimated value derived from:

| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Brand tier (Club Car, E-Z-GO, Yamaha, Star EV, ICON, other) | Base |
| Model year (depreciation curve) | Age multiplier |
| Battery type (lithium vs. lead-acid) | +15–25% for lithium |
| Battery capacity (Ah) | Linear scaling |
| Battery age (months) | Depreciation factor |
| Seating (2 vs. 4 vs. 6 passenger) | Tier multiplier |
| Lifted | +$500–800 |
| Street legal claimed | +$300–500 |
| Charger included | +$150–300 |
| Warranty included | +$200–500 |
| Seller type (dealer premium vs. private discount) | ±5–8% |

### Total Delivered Cost (TDC)

```
TDC = askingPrice + estimatedDeliveryCost (if deliveryAvailable = true)
    = askingPrice (if deliveryAvailable = false or deliveryIncluded = true)
```

Delivery cost is suppressed from API responses when `deliveryAvailable = false` — the internal $350 estimate is used for scoring only.

### Deal Rating

```
deltaPct = (TDC - EV) / EV

great_deal  : deltaPct ≤ -0.15   (15%+ below market)
good_deal   : -0.15 < deltaPct ≤ -0.05
fair_price  : -0.05 < deltaPct ≤ 0.05
high_price  : 0.05 < deltaPct ≤ 0.15
over_market : deltaPct > 0.15    (15%+ above market)
```

### Negotiation Range

```
negotiationLow  = round(EV × 0.88)   // fair floor — 12% below market
negotiationHigh = round(EV × 1.02)   // fair ceiling — 2% above market
```

Both bounds are anchored entirely to the CartIQ EV — not the asking price.

## Data Sources & Connectors

CartIQ is built to aggregate from multiple sources. Current status:

| Source | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Private sellers (manual) | ✅ Live | Via Sell My Cart form |
| Dealer direct (manual/CSV) | ✅ Live | Admin CSV import |
| Facebook Marketplace | 🚫 Disabled | Meta's Content Library API is academic/non-profit only — not available for commercial use. Compliant path: licensed third-party data (BrightData, SociaVault) when budget allows. |
| Costco / Retail | 🚫 Disabled | No approved API/feed access. Placeholder for future licensed feed. |

The connector placeholders are intentionally disabled and gated — no automated scraping is performed.

---

## Admin Portal

Access at `/#/admin`. Default password: `cartiq2024` (change via `ADMIN_TOKEN` env var).

**Capabilities:**
- Create, edit, delete listings
- Trigger price updates (automatically fires price-drop alerts to watchers)
- Bulk import via CSV
- Manage inventory sources

**Security:** The admin token is validated server-side on every admin route. The client-side gate uses a SHA-256 prefix check to avoid storing the plaintext token in the JS bundle.

---

## My Garage (Watch & Save)

Email-based, no account required. User enters email once — stored in localStorage (with in-memory fallback for iframe environments).

### Save a Cart (Heart ❤️)
- Click the heart icon on any listing card or detail page
- Listing appears in My Garage → Saved Carts tab
- Remove anytime with the trash icon

### Watch for Price Drops (Bell 🔔)
- Click the bell icon on any listing card or detail page
- CartIQ records the current asking price as the watch price
- If an admin drops the price below the watch price, an alert fires immediately
- Alerts appear in My Garage → Price Alerts tab with old price → new price and % drop badge
- Dismiss an alert without removing the watch, or remove the watch entirely

> Email delivery of alerts is on the roadmap. Currently alerts are in-app only.

---

## CSV Import Format

Upload via Admin Portal → CSV Import, or `POST /api/admin/csv-import` with `{ csvText: "..." }`.

**Required columns:** `brand`, `model`, `year`, `city`, `state`, `power_type`, `battery_type`, `price`

**Optional columns:** `sale_price`, `regular_price`, `title`, `zip`, `battery_ah`, `battery_age_months`, `seating`, `lifted`, `street_legal_claimed`, `charger_included`, `warranty_included`, `delivery_available`, `delivery_included`, `estimated_delivery_cost`, `seller_type`, `source_type`, `condition`, `image_url`, `description`, `retailer_name`, `external_url`

**Boolean fields** (`lifted`, `street_legal_claimed`, `charger_included`, `warranty_included`, `delivery_available`, `delivery_included`): accept `yes`, `no`, `true`, `false`.

**Notes:**
- Rows with no price (`price`, `sale_price`, and `regular_price` all empty) are skipped with an error
- Column count mismatches are documented behavior — extra/missing columns produce a row-level error

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy from project root
vercel --prod
```

The project includes `vercel.json` for proper routing configuration.

**Important:** Vercel deployments use the SQLite `data.db` file for persistence. For multi-region or production-grade storage, migrate to PostgreSQL (Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale). The Drizzle schema is PostgreSQL-compatible — swap the `better-sqlite3` driver for `postgres-js` and update connection strings.

### Railway

```bash
# Set env vars in Railway dashboard, then:
railway up
```

### Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci && npm run build
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.cjs"]
```

---

CartIQ MVP covers **Florida** and **Georgia** only. The backend schema and filtering support adding additional states — the `PILOT_STATES` constant in `server/routes.ts` controls which states are accepted.

Featured markets:
- Nocatee, FL (St. Johns County master-planned community)
- The Villages, FL (premier senior golf cart community)
- Jacksonville, FL
- Orlando, FL
- Peachtree City, GA (largest golf cart city in the US)
